As the cohort comes to a close, I want to take a moment to reflect on this incredible journey. One of the most memorable aspects of this experience was definitely the weekly calls. I really enjoyed connecting with everyone, sharing insights, and getting the chance to learn directly from experts in the field. The sense of community and support throughout the cohort was invaluable.

What I found particularly useful during this program was learning about Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). I only knew about BIP before joining the cohort, but after the lecture during our weekly meeting and doing my own research, I now have a much deeper understanding of them. I’ve even gained insights into the upcoming "Pectra" upgrade, which was a fascinating discovery for me.

The most challenging part of the cohort was definitely dealing with multiple rounds of feedback on my issues, but the persistence paid off when my work was eventually merged. It was a tough process, but ultimately rewarding, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come in handling GitHub-related issues. This was a significant skill that I can now apply moving forward.

In terms of new skills, I’ve gained a solid understanding of how to troubleshoot and resolve GitHub issues, along with a broader knowledge of Ethereum clients and how they interact within the ecosystem. These are skills I’ll definitely be using as I continue to explore blockchain development.

I’d love to dive even deeper into EIPs, especially as I’m becoming more fascinated with them. The Perctra upgrade in particular caught my attention, and I’m eager to explore its implications further.

Overall, my excitement for the Ethereum Protocol has grown exponentially throughout this cohort. I’m more passionate than ever about pursuing a future in this space, and I’m hopeful about the opportunities that lie ahead.

I’m incredibly grateful for everything I’ve learned and the connections I’ve made here. This cohort has been an eye-opening experience, and I’m excited for what the future holds.
