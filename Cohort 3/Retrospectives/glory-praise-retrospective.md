First of all, WIEP Cohort 3 was an incredible experience.
Its quite different from other programs I have attended. It was very hands on and practical.

The most memorable part for me is the weekly task.  They helped me reinforce everything we learned during the week. Having to actually try things out made the knowledge stick. Repeating and practicing what I learned helped me understand it on a deeper level.

I found the Github/Git sessions very useful.  I already had some basic knowledge, but I got to explore areas I hadn’t touched before like cherry-pick. I learned how to use the different commands better. 

The EIP workshops and learning about the different Ethereum clients were fascinating. Contributing to open source has always felt scary to me. I used to worry that I wouldn’t be able to solve issues or that core devs wouldn’t even respond. But going through this experience helped me break past those fears. The WIEP team was so supportive, and the core devs were actually really kind and responsive. I definitely want to keep contributing especially to core clients and protocols.

Honestly, this experience gave me a deeper appreciation for Ethereum as a protocol. I love how open and inclusive the community is. It’s really a place where anyone can contribute and grow. I'm happy to be part of it and I’m committed to showing up and giving back however I can.

If I could suggest anything, it would be to share all the core client options we could contribute to much earlier in the program. That way, we can start exploring them, choose where we want to contribute, and begin engaging more intentionally from the start. But overall, this experience really pushed me in the best way possible and I’m genuinely thankful for it.

I’m truly grateful for this learning opportunity. The program was well-structured, impactful, and full of support. Huge thanks to Katya for the check-ins and constant encouragement, it was really helpful. I definitely hope to stay connected and contribute more to this amazing community.
