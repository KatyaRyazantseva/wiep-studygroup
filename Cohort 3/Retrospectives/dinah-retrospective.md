#### A memorable moment for me
I think the mooment when i had help fixing my first git conflict from this cohort was quite memorable for me. 
It was easy pulling from upstream, merging to main and switching branches but dealing with cherry pick slightly confused me. I'm glad Katya was willing to help me through it. She never made me silly for not knowing such a simple concept and I truly appreciate that. 

What did you find particularly useful during the cohort?
#### What I found useful
The constant updates weekly, both on github and through zoom. It helped me remain accountable as i was trying to juggle all the things going on in my life. 

#### Which parts of the cohort felt challenging or were unclear?
The cohort itself was not confusing to me honestly. I just had to get used to the rhythm of things. HOwever, when i tried contributing to lodestar, i did get a bit overwhelemed from how large and big their repository was. 
But i just had to get more familiar with it. 
I realized I needed something just like this cohort once more. 


#### What new skills or insights have you gained from the cohort?
My developer skills have drastically improved. despite i don;t know everything, i know a lot mroe. I learnt more about researching when dealing with EIPs. seeing how they are all related was very fascinating to me. I intend to study more along the way. 



#### What do you think of the Ethereum Protocol after the cohort?
I have a lot mroe respect for them now. I never knew it took so much dedication, effort and such intense details. Normally when i heard there were not many Ethereum Protocol Engineers, I never thought much of it. But now, i see there is a lot of work. 
All the different teams do their tasks and make it all such a success.
