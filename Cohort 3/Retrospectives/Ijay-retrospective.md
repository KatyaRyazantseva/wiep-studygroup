### Retrospective – Abigael Nyangasi (Ijay)

This cohort has been one of the most transformative learning experiences I’ve had so far in web3. What stands out most is the shift from seeing Ethereum as "just a platform" to recognizing it as a living protocol that evolves through community and meticulous engineering.

**Most Memorable:**  
- Contributing my first PR to **Lodestar** during cohort coding sessions.
- The guest lectures from core devs-especially on weak subjectivity and validator economics.

**What Was Useful:**  
- Hands-on study sessions dissecting EIPs and consensus specs.
- The mentor check-ins; having someone who has been through this path was invaluable.

**Challenges:**  
- Grasping the intricacies of the consensus layer felt overwhelming at times. I found the relationship between the spec and client implementations tricky to parse.
- I could use more structure when it comes to understanding how different clients approach things differently.

**New Skills & Insights:**  
- Reading spec code and cross-referencing it with client codebases.
- Better appreciation of the importance of client diversity.  
- Confidence to ask “dumb” questions in core dev spaces!

**What I Want To Explore More:**  
- More hands-on with sync algorithms (Fast Sync, Snap Sync, WS Sync).
- Contributing beyond TypeScript (potentially dabbling in Go/Rust clients).

**Thoughts on Ethereum Protocol:**  
It feels less like a rigid set of rules and more like an open canvas where new ideas like Verkles and PBS keep challenging the boundaries. It’s humbling to see how many contributions happen beyond the spec—testing, tooling, community.
