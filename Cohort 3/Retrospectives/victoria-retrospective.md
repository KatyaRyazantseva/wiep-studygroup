### What was most memorable for you?
One of the most memorable parts of the cohort was contributing directly to the Ethereum protocol through the Lodestar repository. Submitting a pull request and receiving feedback from real protocol engineers was both exciting and humbling. I also really appreciated the weekly calls and standups—especially when experienced speakers came to share deep insights about different aspects of the Ethereum protocol.



### What did you find particularly useful during the cohort?

The weekly standups, structured guidance, and access to supportive mentors were incredibly helpful. Katya in particular was amazing—she followed up with us consistently to ensure we weren't stuck and helped keep the momentum going. The communication channels, including GitHub and Discord, were also very active and supportive. Reviewers on my PR were kind and willing to guide us through the process, which made the learning curve less intimidating.

### Which parts of the cohort felt challenging or were unclear?
Initially, understanding the inner workings of Ethereum clients like Lodestar and how they relate to the broader Ethereum protocol was challenging. It took time to get comfortable with the codebase and understand where I could contribute meaningfully. But thanks to the guidance from mentors and the structure of the cohort, things started to click over time.


### What new skills or insights have you gained from the cohort?
I gained a much clearer understanding of how Ethereum works under the hood—especially around consensus, networking, and client implementation. I also improved my GitHub collaboration skills, learned how to navigate open-source codebases more confidently.


### What would you like to explore in more depth within the cohort topics?
I’d love to explore more about how different Ethereum clients interact and how upgrades are coordinated across them. Diving deeper into how protocol specs are implemented, tested, and standardized would also be fascinating. I’d also like to learn more about consensus mechanisms and how validator logic is implemented.


### What do you think of the Ethereum Protocol after the cohort?
After this cohort, I have even more respect for the Ethereum protocol and the people building it. It’s a living, breathing ecosystem with so many moving parts, and being able to contribute—even in a small way—has been incredibly rewarding. I now understand the importance of community-driven development and open collaboration. This cohort gave me a strong foundation, and I owe a lot of my new knowledge and confidence to the Women in Ethereum Protocol (WIEP) community.
